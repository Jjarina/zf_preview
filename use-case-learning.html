    <p>Documents are outdated and generally avoided by customers and employees or any organization. Whereas, short sites with interactive information are much more intuitive and beneficial. Zoomforth has allowed us to better communicate things and create a sense of eagerness in our employees to read, learn with interaction.</p>

    <p>Zoomforth is essentially our company's intranet - we link various sites and pages to share information and resources with our internal employees.
