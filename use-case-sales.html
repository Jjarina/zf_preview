    <p>The microsites are a wonderful tool to help us in client pursuits. They allow us the ability to really go deep on our [firm] difference, accolades, client case studies, and videos that we normally would not be able to present in a PowerPoint or RFP response. In addition, the ability to add industry-specific insights and information provides us the opportunity to keep the client engaged throughout the entire process and increase our win rate.</p>

    <blockquote class="page-quote">
    <p>The use of microsites in the sales process has allowed us to show our clients that we are truly digital, just like our delivery methodology. We are able to move away from printing out thick paper decks and presenting structured slide shows to be more dynamic with our clients. Microsites allow us to put the depth of [firm’s] thought leadership and experience at the fingertips of our clients — all in an interactive, digital format that is simple to update on the fly.</p>

    <p>Not only are we closing deals faster. But we’re also increasing the amount of closed deals. We probably saw an extra couple hundred thousand dollars in revenue in just the first quarter just by using this platform.</p>

    <p>Microsite proposals are not a new idea, but Zoomforth allows you to produce them at scale so they are the default, not the exception.</p>
