In this video, we will walk through how to create a site by duplicating an existing site or creating a site from a template, so you can start building out your content.

## Creating a new site from a template

Start in the sites and templates dashboard. We will begin by creating a site from a template. This is considered best practice as a template can serve as a framework and contain placeholders for images, documents, and links to customize your site.

Find the template you would like to use. When you hover over, a more option will appear, and from the dropdown, select create site from template. This will bring up a popover to set the title and description of your site.

A few notes, the title can be edited at a later stage, so it's okay if you don't have the official naming worked out from the outset. Once you do, the title will be visible, so make sure it is something you are comfortable sharing with a wider audience. Now, the description is used internally to help identify the site's purpose. As more sites are built by you and your colleagues, the description field can help distinguish between sites in your account.

Once you're done, select the blue button, create site. This will open up the site editor in a new tab. You can learn more [about the site editor]({{'platform-site-editor'|relative_url}}){:target="_blank"} in the proceeding videos. Your dashboard will now display the new site, and the count of sites will be reflected here too.

## Duplicating a site

The second way of creating a site is through duplicating an existing site. Again, simply hover over the site you wish to use. The "more" option will appear once again, this time the prompt will say duplicate. The popover to set the title and description will appear again. When you select duplicate site, the site editor will also appear in a new tab.

Your site will be reflected in your dashboard. Duplicating a site is the best way to try an existing site design, and to ensure you're not making changes to the live or original site. Duplicating ensures you're making a copy of it.

Now, you know how to create a site. Go ahead and try duplicating an existing site or creating one from a template.
