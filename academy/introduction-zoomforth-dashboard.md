In this video, I'll be giving you a short tour of the Zoomforth dashboard so you know where to find all the resources you need to make and manage your sites.

This initial view is the back end of Zoomforth. It's the first thing you'll see when you log into your account. The platform is made up of seven key sections:

1. Sites and templates
2. Stats and reports
3. Links and tracking
4. Media library
5. Prompts
6. Forums
7. Themes

Let's start at the top with sites and templates. This is where you're going to  spend most of your time. It's where you can quickly create customized sites and templates.

## Stats and reports

This section allows you to understand engagement across your account. How many sites your team has created, how many visitors you had across your sites, and your team usage. Now, please note this section is only visible to admins of the account.

## Links and tracking

Here you can identify all links created in your account. By default, you will see the dashboard only shows you links you have created. So to view all links in your account, you simply need to clear the filter. Now you can see which links are recently active, and you can compare the performance of links with different audiences.

## Your media library

This is a repository of your images, videos, and PDFs. Think of it as a content management system to keep you organized and find your assets quickly.

## Prompts

A prompt is a feature that allows you to ask your site visitors questions, and you can have them upload their answers in the form of a copy, document, or video.

## Forms

Zoomforth provides an easy way to gather information from your visitors on your sites. So whether you want to create a signup form, or maybe you have a quick survey, you can create and add these forms through this section.

## Themes

A theme is a style sheet that controls the fonts, colors, and component styles of your sites. Your default theme, which we provide, will already have all of your brandings. But if you'd like to create a theme in other colors and fonts, you're going to do that here.

## Support services

Now, wherever you are on the platform, you always have access to our support resources by clicking on the blue chat button down at the bottom of your screen.

This is where you can find the link to our chat and our support team. Our support team is super responsive. They're available 24 hours a day from Monday through Friday, above the send us a message button you can see how long the wait time is for a response. This is how you can send them a message.

Below that, you'll also find a link to our help center, so you can search for any term, and the relevant how-to articles will show up.

Every week we offer a drop-in session. They're open to all of our customers, and everyone shows up as anonymous. If you'd like to register for this option, click on the sign up button.

Next is our library of videos. This is where you can see videos such as this one across all areas of our platform.

## ProductBoard

Finally, our ProductBoard. Your opinion is important to us. This is where you can give us feedback on the product. If you have a product suggestion or feedback, you can submit it by clicking on the submit idea button at the top right. This is also the area in the platform where you can see our product roadmap and vote on features that you're most excited about.

That's a quick tour of the main dashboard and the different resources available to you. For more information on how to use the platform, please see the next module in the video series.
