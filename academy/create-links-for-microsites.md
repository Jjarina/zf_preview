In this video, we will review links that enable you to personalize a URL for a particular audience that leads to the same site.

You can find all the links for the site in the links tab of the details view. Here, you can enable new links to be created.

You can also click on the existing links to view or edit the settings.

Select the blue button, create new link, to get started.

A popup window will allow you to edit the field in white. You can see it has auto-populated the original URL but added a one to the ending. This is to differentiate the new link for the site.

Users often customize this with a company name, individual client names, or where the site is being promoted, such as LinkedIn or an internal board.

This proves useful as creating multiple links allows you to augment your site's analytics so you can separately track the site for each link. This can help understand patterns of reach.

Settings, such as asking for a visitor's name and email and subscribing to email notifications are also offered with subsequent links. When you've confirmed the new URL pack, select create link. You can copy the new URL path in the text box and share it with your audience.

Now we've reviewed the links tab. Go ahead and try creating a new link for one of your sites. For more information on how to use this platform. Please see the modules in this video series.
