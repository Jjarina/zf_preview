The media library contains all the assets that can be added to your Zoomforth site. Assets are organized by type. You can upload files, photos, and even videos.

## How to add assets to the media library

There are two ways to add assets to the media library. The first is by simply dragging and dropping from your desktop. The second way is by using the upload media button. This will allow you to add assets from your drive. In both options, the asset type, the name, and the date that it was last modified will be listed alongside the asset.

## How to organize assets

Organizing assets into folders will allow you to quickly locate the correct asset when you're trying to add it to a site. Select the create folder button, and a popover will appear to name it. Click on any folder, and the option on the right-hand side will allow you to rename the folder, move the location, and even delete the folder.

There are two features that I do want to share. You can add a name and description to any photo. When you select the asset, the option on the right-hand side will allow you to edit the name and add a description.

If this is a description or a name that will be used across several sites, you may want to consider adding it as a default by using this option here.

## Updating assets across all sites

Lastly, you can update any asset across all of your sites in just a few clicks. For example, let's pick a PDF file. If there's a new version, such as version two, that you'd like to update in the media library and across every site it's listed, you can use the replace button on the right-hand side. This will prompt you with all of the sites that the current PDF file is listed. Select a single site or all the sites where you'd like to update that file. When completed, it will prompt you with "done." Now you can keep all your sites updated simultaneously.

That's a quick tour of the media library. For more information on how to use the platform. Please see the next modules in this video series.
