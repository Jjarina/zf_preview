Tagging and filtering allow you to create tags to assign to content which allows your visitors more control over what content is being displayed to them.

## How to apply tagging and filtering

The first thing you want to do is find the section you want to apply tagging and filtering to. In this instance, I'm doing it with my supporting team content. When I click into that section on the bottom left-hand side, I have an enable filtering option. I need to select that first, and then I can edit. When I do that, I can assign the filtering options that will be available to my visitors. I can then also pick the method by which my visitors are going to be able to filter through.

**Example 1**:  I'm going to create a category called content type, and I'm going to have a tag for YouTube and a tag for video. This first filtering method will allow my visitor to select both YouTube and video, and the content that will then be displayed to them is anything tagged as YouTube or video. The second option is similar, but it's an and. So with the second option, we have the same scenario, except that when my visitor selects YouTube and video, they're only going to be displayed content tagged YouTube and video. So it gets a bit more granular; therefore, they have more control and are more limited in what they see. You can also go with different filtering types. This is more of a visual element. You have three options; I suggest playing around to see which one you visually think fits with what you're trying to display on your site.

**Example 2**: Then we have our groups. In this instance, I will choose roles, and now I have to create my tags. I'm going to go with a manager, a lead, and an associate tag. I can create an additional layer of filtering by going to the new filter category. But because I am done, I'm going to exit. Now I have to apply those filters I created, or those tags, to my tiles. I'm going to come to my first one on the bottom left-hand side, I have my filtering tags, and I will edit. In this instance I know that Allen is a manager, John is an associate, and Steve is my lead. I can continue doing this for every tile that I'd like.

To see what this looks like, letâ€™s go to the preview on the top right-hand side. It takes me to the page to which I've applied the tagging filtering, and as a visitor, I can say I want to see who the manager is. I want to see who reports to him, or maybe I just want to see the person I'll be interacting with on a day-in and day-out basis. And that's how we apply tagging and filtering.
