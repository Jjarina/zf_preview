In this video, we will review the key [difference between a site]({% post_url 2023-01-06-landing-page-vs-website-whats-the-difference %}){:target="_blank"} and a template, and how to keep your dashboard organized through folders.

The sites and template dashboard is the first thing you'll see when you log in to your account. Sites and templates are organized separately into different tabs.

## What is a template?

A template is a premade layout you can use to create a site quickly. It is often a framework that has your logo and baseline content. Some good examples where a template is often used are monthly newsletters, a sales proposal, or recruiting sites where most of the site structure is the same, but you may customize the content depending on your audience.

## What is a site?

A site is a customized version of that template or a site built entirely from scratch. It will therefore have a unique URL. If there's a specific site or template you're looking for, you may want to use the search bar to find it quickly. Here, you can search for a term such as sales, and Zoomforth will quickly identify the number of sites and templates that match that term.

## How to organize your sites

As your team creates more sites, you'll want to organize those sites by using folders. You can see that here on the left-hand side.

There are a couple ways of doing this. The first is through the manage button. When I select that, a popover will appear, and this is where I can expand, collapse, and create new folders.

Let's create a new folder together now. I'm going to call it bids. If I need to rename, delete, or create a subfolder, those options appear anytime I hover over a folder.

The second way of creating folders is through the details tab. Just below the site's name, you will see an icon folder. When you hover it, you can edit the folder, and the same popover and options will appear and be granted to you. When you join an existing account, a structured folder may already be in place, so I recommend speaking to the account admin to see how you can follow suit.

Lastly, I want to mention that when you create a site or publish a site, it will automatically be filed under no folder. So it's up to you to manually select the site and assign it to one. A good example is my HR solutions bid that I created today. As you can see, no folder is assigned. Let's go ahead and organize it together.

I'm going to select the edit folder and I'm gonna move it to our proposals folder. Now that I selected it, I can see a popup notification saying the folder has been successfully moved, and my dashboard has also been updated. And that's it.

Now, you know the difference between a site and a template and how you can organize your sites into folders. For more information on how to use the platform, please see the next modules in this video series.
