Analytics is a summary of metrics designed to identify the number of visitors to your site, what content they're engaging with, and how they're arriving at your site. This is the best way to understand the traffic you receive on a per-site basis.

By default, you will see analytics over the entire lifetime of your site. The day it was published, until right now. You can choose to narrow that timeframe by adjusting the date range above the graph. You can also filter out and hide visits by domain. This filter works on the principle of exclusion. This means when you select a field, it will hide visitors that match those criteria. This allows you to hone your list of visitors quickly.

## Site visits

A site visit occurs when a user loads your site in their browser. Zoomforth tracks the total visits you have received and makes a distinction between new visitors, and those that have returned to the site. You can find an explanation of each term by hovering over the graph, where the word visits is listed with a question mark next to it.

Along with raw visit counts, Zoomforth also provides a graph of visits over time. For example, if you hosted an event and advertised your website, you may see a significant spike in traffic during this time.

## Understanding user sessions

If you want to understand user sessions, the table to the right quickly highlights the most recent visitors. The details view provides data on visitor journeys based on their name, email, location, and the time they accessed the site. Hover over any row, and a details link will appear. This will give you a granular view of the content they engaged with and for how long.

To generate a report to share with stakeholders, simply click the download icon in the top right-hand corner of your screen.

Please note, if your site visitors appear anonymous, this is likely because you haven't implemented a method to capture visitor data or because your visitors have declined to provide their details.

## Top subpage

For a site with multiple subpages, this graph shows you the number of visitors per page. This helps you understand whether there is a drop-off or emphasis on one subpage over another. It can also suggest the need to add more dynamic content to subpages with low engagement.

## Top content

Here, you can see which pieces of content your visitors engage with most. Zoomforth will track the following interactions in this section, playing a video, displaying an image, opening a PDF, following a link, and submitting a form.

## Top referrals

If you share your link in several places by email or various social media platforms, you can evaluate how traffic is coming to your site by reviewing the referral domains or URLs.

## Devices

This is where you can see how visitors are accessing your site on a desktop, mobile, or tablet. This may suggest a need to optimize designs for a popular device type.
