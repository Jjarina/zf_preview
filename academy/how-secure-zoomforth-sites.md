In this video, we will review the visitor access settings to control which external audience can visit your site. To begin, hover over the site you would like to secure. Select the details button and then the visitor access tab. Zoomforth provides several ways to restrict site access, including password authentication, approved emails, multi-factor, and single sign-on. Let's review each now.

**Public**: A public site can be viewed by anyone once published. This means anyone with access to the link can view the site. Here, you can set your search engine settings and allow or disable search engines from calling the site.

**Password**: A site with password authentication will allow the site to be viewed by anyone who enters the correct password. The first time you select this for each site, you will need to set a password. You can then choose to view or change the site's password.

**Approved emails**: The site with approved emails will require visitors to confirm their email if on the approved list. You must set the emails or domains in the text box. You can also use the bulk edit button to add an email roster. Select next and save.

**Multi-Factor**: A site with Multi-Factor authentication will only allow visitors to view a site after they confirm access to an email explicitly allowed, And after entering the code from the enrolled device. You must set the emails and domains under the Multi-Factor setting.

**Single Sign-On**: enterprise customers may integrate their Zoomforth account with SAML. SAML allows employees to access private sites shared with the company network. Keep in mind that to access this option, the account you are using will need to have SAML configured with a Single Sign-On portal. Once SAML is selected for a site, visitors already logged into their Single Sign-On account can directly access the site. Otherwise, they will be redirected to the sign-on portal and then granted access.

Now we viewed the visitor access options. Go ahead and secure your own site with a setting that works best for you and your team. For more information on how to use the platform, please see the next modules in this video series.
