      <h2>Get high level microsite visitor data</h2>
      <p>The great thing about microsites, when compared to the humble PDF or PowerPoint, is that you can collect visitor data.</p>
      <p>The real value of data analytics is that it will help you refine your approach as you learn what resonates with your audience.</p>
      <p>Granular visitor data will give you  a fascinating insight into what your audience cares about the most. Did they watch your video? Did they look through your presentation? How far did they get? You’ll see all this and more.</p>
