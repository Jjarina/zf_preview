      <p>Yes. You can purchase additional user seats mid-term or other add-ons such as a custom domain or custom integration.</p>
      <p>Additional services purchased mid-term will be charged on a prorated basis and will renew on the same date as your original agreement.</p>
      <p>If you need to reduce the number of seats held, or cancel add-on services, you can do this by giving thirty (30) days’ notice ahead of the next renewal date.</p>

     <div class="faq-answer">
      <p>Zoomforth is a fully distributed company so has no office building to heat, light and maintain.</p>
      <p>Our team uses laptops and makes use of cloud-based services, so we rarely need to print anything on paper.</p>
      <p>Travel is restricted to business-essential and we use <a href="https://terrapass.com/" target="_blank">Terrapass</a> to offset carbon on any flights we take.</p>
      <p>In conjunction with <a href="https://onetreeplanted.org/" target="_blank">One Tree Planted</a>, Zoomforth plants a tree for every new Zoomforth user that signs up.</p>
      <p>Zoomforth is proud to be supporting our customers’ own ESG agendas, by offering a digital  alternative to printed PDFs and PowerPoint decks.</p>
