      <h2>What are business sales proposals?</h2>
      <p>A business proposal is a physical or digital document used to pitch products or services to potential clients or customers.</p>
      <p>Traditionally delivered in hard-copy or as presentations, the age of digital information has greatly expanded the forms a business proposal can take.</p>
      <p>In the early days of the office computer, business proposals changed very little. Various forms of digital media (such as embedded audio and video) have existed since even before the Internet hit the mass market. However, proposal techniques were slow to take advantage of them.</p>

    <section class="page-inner pillar-content">
      <p>Although email replaced fax machines and sales proposals were increasingly created digitally, the assumption remained that these documents would be printed onto paper to be read. This didn’t change until well into the new millennium.</p>
      <p>As a result, sales proposals continued to persist as often extremely long text documents consumed linearly, much as one would read other business documents outside of sales and pursuits.</p> 
      <p>These documents, still common even today, usually take the form of an emailed PDF, rarely making concessions to the needs or role of the individual reader. This still relatively widespread practice of delivering one-size-fits-all sales proposals overlooks the fact that such documents are circulated around various departments and stakeholders within recipient organizations, for whom only a small fraction of the information contained may be actionable or even relevant.</p>
      <p>Fortunately, documents in this style are gradually being replaced by sales proposals in far more customizable and engaging formats. While the emailed PDF is still commonplace, innovative sales and pursuits teams are increasingly embracing the microsite or landing page as their preferred solution for digital sales proposals.</p>
      <p>Microsites are excellent proposal tools because they help you create online proposals. Online proposals have a number of advantages over traditional proposals such as easy navigability, engaging, varied, and interactive content, as well as access to detailed analytics. It is this kind of digital sales proposal that is the focus of this guide.</p>

        <h2>Traditional versus online business proposals: what are the differences?</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Traditional client pitches</strong> often take the form of multiple emails with large attachments or linked sources, each of which could  lead a client to any one of numerous online docs. These pitches frequently lack built-in security and can make it difficult for the prospect to try and track down information they’re looking for through multiple email chains  or PDFs scattered throughout their inbox. </li>
          <li><strong>Digital proposal pitches</strong> are often single websites where all relevant information  can be accessed, such as all downloadable attachments.  Proposals can be secured with multi-factor authentication and analytics and data insights are readily available. With digital proposals, you know where to find the information you’re looking for and you can feel confident it’s well protected. The content can also be much more engaging.</li>

      <h2>What information do professional business proposals contain?</h2>
      <p>While the specifics of sales proposals differ based upon the product or service being offered, as well as the intended recipient, the majority of quality proposals include the following elements:</p>

    <section class="pillar-content page-inner align-center">
      <p>While the executive summary is the last step in writing a business proposal, it’s arguably the most important. It contains the essence of your sales proposal and is the first place most people start when reading proposals, let’s consider how to prepare one effectively.</p>

        <h2>How to write an executive summary</h2>
        <p>In a traditional sales proposal, an executive summary is the first thing anyone reading the document will come across, except for perhaps your company logo.</p>
        <p>The executive summary is important because it distills the most important take-aways from your proposal into just a few sentences. This means that your time-strapped prospects will likely check it first before deciding whether the rest of your proposal is worth reading. The executive summary also plays the role of introducing your audience to what your proposal is about. So, how can you leverage the power of executive summaries or introduction? You can make the introduction of a proposal more persuasive if you do the following:</p>

        <h2>Why use online business proposal software?</h2>
        <p>Now we’ve covered what to include in sales proposals and some key steps you can take to improve your own, it’s time to consider your options on where to create them.</p>
        <p>We’ve established that digital proposals are the modern solution for winning new business. They can make  interactions with prospects more informative, relevant, and efficient.</p>
        <p>But why use specialist digital proposal software such as high-end microsite builders rather than preparing a PDF in an old-fashioned word processor? </p>
        <p>The days of in-person pitches, emailed PDF proposals and even standalone PowerPoints are numbered. As much as we may hate to admit it, round table client meetings followed by cocktails are becoming things of the past.</p>
        <p>Today the most secure and customizable way to pitch a client is with a <a href="https://blog.zoomforth.com/digital-proposals-change-the-way-you-pitch-clients/" target="_blank">digital proposal</a>.

        <h2>How can digital proposal microsites boost your bottom line?</h2>
        <p>The business case for digital sales proposals built on microsites is financial. Digital proposals can help to increase sales by:</p>
        <p><strong class="color-blue">Differentiation</strong> - In a crowded marketplace, it’s important to stand out. A well-made microsite-based sales proposal gives far greater scope for creativity in this area while demonstrating digitally forward-thinking.</p>
        <p><strong class="color-blue">Data-driven decision making</strong> - Objection handling is a crucial sales skill, and by understanding your prospects’ priorities through analytics by seeing where they focus their attention on each page you have a greater chance of successfully anticipating their interests and addressing their specific objections.</p> 
        <p><strong class="color-blue">Instant responses</strong> - Among platforms for digital sales proposals, Zoomforth in particular gives you the power to approach prospects at just the right moment by letting you know when a potential client has viewed your proposal.</p>
        <p><strong class="color-blue">Leveraging branding</strong> - A well defined brand communicates certain values that help potential customers connect with the associated company. A microsite-based digital sales proposal offers greater opportunities to integrate brand elements with the rich variety of content that can be displayed along with the overall on-page design. Templates help ensure that content remains customizable while brand compliance is adhered to.</p>

      <h2>Digital proposal software: moving beyond PowerPoint and PDF pitches</h2>
      <p>Many firms are still submitting bids using older digital business proposal tools that arrived on the market long ago; PowerPoint presentations and PDFs.</p>
      <h4>Why?</h4>
      <p>The answer is complex. Ask some professional services firms and they’ll tell you it’s to do with legacy policies and systems, custom and practice, and a historic lack of enterprise-ready tools to enable more eye catching solutions. But things are starting to change. And the digital proposal is the fastest way for your company to react to this change. A digital proposal allows you to provide rich content experiences that integrate different types of media in engaging ways—well beyond what an emailed PDF can do.</p>

        <h2>Why should you create proposals online?</h2>
        <p>Any new business proposal  will be looked at by multiple people while under review. Herein lies <a href="{{ 'blog/powerpoint-alternatives-for-a-modern-sales-solution' | relative_url }}" target="_blank">the problem with existing solutions</a> like PowerPoint presentations and PDFs. Sales proposals in their traditional, PDF form contain all the information that could be pertinent to every stakeholder. But, because every stakeholder has to review a PDF of 50+ pages, many will lose interest as they struggle their way through a one-size-fits-all document of which only a few pages may be relevant to them. They risk missing key information.</p>

      <div class="content-wrap md-fifty-percent pr-md-0 pr-0">
        <div class="with-box">
        <h3>Online proposal creation gives you these benefits</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>1. Detailed analytics mean you can see how your proposal is being received at the other end. Unlike with a PDF, you can see which parts of the site recipients are engaging with, whether or not they read through your key points, and gain similar useful insights.</li>
          <li>2. Each stakeholder can quickly find and review the information that is most relevant to them.</li>
          <li>3. They may not even have to do that, as individually customized sites or subpages can be sent to each specific stakeholder containing only the information that they personally need.</li>
          <li>4. You can embed any necessary documentation right inside your proposal where it can easily be found and accessed.</li>
          <li>5. By hosting your digital proposal on a microsite  you avoid it getting lost in an inbox.</li>
          <li>6. Combine materials so they don’t feel dry or one-dimensional - a greater variety of digital content types (such as video, audio, or flashy animations) allows for a powerful experience.</li>

        <span class="eyebrow">Customizable mini-website</span>
        <h2>What is a microsite?</h2>
        <p>A microsite is different from a standard webpage on your website because it stands alone, separate from your primary URL.</p>
        <p>In simple terms, it’s a customizable mini-website used to convey specific information to a particular audience.</p>
        <p>These microsites are usually associated with a particular project, event, launch, or similar highly specific activity with an expiry date.</p>
        <p>For example, a large professional services firm might be trying to win the business of a specific financial institution in response to an RFP.</p>
        <p>In such a case, it may make sense to have a dedicated site specifically for hiring in that market. It would be written in the local language, contain advice to help potential candidates decide between different positions they might want to apply for, and information about the application and hiring process.</p> 
        <p>Of course, there’s nothing to stop all this information being delivered piecemeal across the firm’s main site. However, a microsite allows for it to be concentrated in a single, easily navigable location with only relevant content to prevent the user having to sift through and find that which pertains to them.</p>
        <p>Although your microsite will likely be brand compliant (in fact, it almost certainly should be), that doesn’t mean it has to be a carbon copy of your main homepage. The freedom of a microsite gives companies room to experiment with new ways of presenting their message.</p>

        <h3>But why use microsites to make proposals?</h3>
        <p>A microsite can be a terrific opportunity to experiment with new types of content delivery and communicate with your audience in new ways. You could test out a new approach on a microsite before rolling it out more widely.</p>
        <p>A key advantage of doing this with a microsite is that you can make use of detailed analytics to test your audience’s response to your new approach to communicating with them. You could even perform a split test, with two microsites reflecting different philosophies and see which performs better.</p>

        <span class="eyebrow">Microsite vs. landing page</span>
        <h2>How is a microsite different from a landing page?</h2>
        <p>There are several differences between microsites and landing pages.</p>
        <p>First, let’s look at the general characteristics of microsites that distinguish them from landing pages:</p>
        <ul class="number-list">
          <li>1. Often more than one page (although some single page and continuous scroll sites can be considered microsites).</li>
          <li>2. Often features a navigation menu.</li>
          <li>3. Generally distinct from the main site of the owning brand.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>By contrast, landing pages are different for the following reasons:</p>
        <ul class="number-list">
          <li>1. One page only.</li>
          <li>2. Often published under the URL of a parent site.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>However, it’s worth noting that there are similarities between the two:</p>
        <ul class="number-list">
          <li>1. Both are usually made for a single, specific purpose.</li>
          <li>2. Microsites and landing pages are both generally smaller than a traditional website.</li>
          <li>3. Each is quite often temporary, with a clear expiration date (usually at the completion of a particular project), but not always.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Why host on a microsite VS a landing page</h2>
        <p>As digital sales proposals often contain a considerable amount of information and microsites are usually larger than individual landing pages, it can make sense to devote an entire microsite to the task as you work to establish and build a productive relationship with your client.</p> 
        <p>A landing page, by contrast, is more effective as a marketing tool since it’s primary function is to attract the attention of new clients, often with the more limited goal of collecting email addresses.</p>
        <p>Despite the higher page count, creating a microsite can be <a href="{{ 'blog/what-is-a-microsite-and-why-do-i-need-one' | relative_url }}" target="_blank">just as easy as designing a landing page</a> while also offering certain other advantages.</p> 
        <p>Here’s a quick rundown of the relative advantages and disadvantages of both microsites and landing pages:</p>

        <h2>How to increase your revenue with digital sales proposals</h2>
        <p>The ultimate goal of creating a sales proposal is to win more clients. Digital sales proposals are a tool to help us achieve it. But how?</p>
        <p>Design a custom experience for every stakeholder. Send the COO directly to an implementation plan, rather than letting them dig for it through a document stuffed with information that, while no doubt useful to other members of their company, is of no direct value to them. You could also create a section of secure financials for the CFO and a direct link to the strategic value of your product for the CEO to look at.</p>
        <p>Appeal to the senses. A microsite allows you to appeal to visual, audio and kinaesthetic learners to give clients a really memorable experience that may give you a leg-up on your competition.</p>
        <p>Appeal to distinct personality types. For those that love to see the ‘big picture’, offer summaries and outlines, clear, purposeful headlines, and interactive design that foregrounds core messages.</p> <p>For detail-oriented stakeholders, add overlays that reveal additional detail when you click or even hover over them. This can add depth and valuable detail to higher-level points. Cater to analytically minded clients with clearly identifiable outcomes, deliverables, figures, and targets.

            Don’t just list all the great things you’ve done for your other clients. Instead, talk about your potential client’s challenges and present some clear ideas on how your company can help overcome them.
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Don’t bury the lead:</h3>
            Make sure you use succinct messages, beautiful visuals, and exciting graphics whenever appropriate so that a quick scan is all it takes for your clients to absorb your core messages.
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Don’t be afraid of empty space:</h3>
            Clear navigation with easy-to-read information and compelling subheadings will make it easy for prospects to scan and digest all the relevant information.  
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Don’t use jargon:</h3>
            Be clear in your messaging. Avoid terms that you may use internally but that might not be familiar to your potential clients.
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Don’t delay:</h3>
            Fast doesn’t have to mean generic. Once you have a template you believe will be effective, you can duplicate  and easily customize it for every potential client going forward. It can take just minutes to get a new microsite up with drag-and-drop features to add in your client’s logo, custom graphics, or links to relevant news articles. Submit your custom proposal first.

        <p>A digital sales proposal hosted on a microsite platform can help achieve this by allowing for encryption and multi-factor authentication.</p>
        <p>For most companies, the thought of a major breach is truly scary, which is why platforms like Zoomforth have taken big steps to ensure information is protected and not retained unnecessarily. While you don’t have the option to un-send an email attachment, microsites give you more control by allowing you to  deactivate sites on a certain date and even delete sensitive information entirely.</p>

        <h2>How to draft proposals while protecting your brand identity?</h2>
        <p>A solid brand helps your company mark itself out as unique. It differentiates <a href="{{ 'blog/growing-a-true-brand-with-digital-sales-proposals' | relative_url }}" target="_blank">you from your competition</a> whenever you submit a bid.</p>
        <p>Strong brands do the following:</p>
        <p><strong>Create consistent client experiences:</strong> be consistent in your branding elements from fonts and colors to visible logos and design standards.</p>
        <p><strong>Increase authority and trust:</strong> create thought-leadership content that your audience will want to read.</p>
        <p><strong>Builds awareness:</strong> the most consistent your brand appears across all channels, from your company website to bids to clients, the more recognizable.</p>
        <p><strong>Distinguish yourself from the competition:</strong> without a doubt, you will run into a competitor trying to sell the same product as you do. Determining your differentiating factor will be a crucial step.</p>
        <p>With a microsite platform staying true to your brand is easier than ever with saved brand guidelines, saved templates, multimedia options and more.</p>

        <h2>How to achieve digital transformation</h2>
        <p>A digital approach to sales proposals and RFPs is one clear way of making sure your sales team is ready for future market changes. But for many companies, making the transition to submitting sales proposals in a new way can feel like too big of a step.</p>
        <p>We’ve made it easy for you to implement everything you’ve read so far with our digital framework that can be applied to any company.</p>
        <p class="mb-0">The four key areas to focus on are:</p>
        <ul class="list-style">
          <li>Strategy</li>
          <li>Customer proposition</li>
          <li>Operations</li>
          <li>Culture</li>
        </ul>
        <p>By investing in a microsite platform like Zoomforth, making these changes on a company wide level isn’t a massive restructure, it’s simply a restructuring of your team’s habits in how they submit proposals.</p>
