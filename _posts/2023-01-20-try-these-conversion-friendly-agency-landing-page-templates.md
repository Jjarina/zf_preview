If you're running an agency, you know how important it is to have a strong online presence. Your website is often the first impression potential clients will have of your business, so it's essential that it makes a good one. One way to ensure that your website is effective is to create a landing page specifically for your agency.

A well-designed landing page can be a powerful marketing tool, helping you generate leads, nurture relationships, and close deals. Not sure where to start? We’ll offer some tips on how to create a conversion-friendly agency landing page. Keep reading to learn more!

## Why do you need a landing page for your agency?

Websites are considerably more general than landing pages, so it’s important to know the difference between the two. Landing pages are valuable tools that boost conversion rates and capture leads. In fact, landing pages that address buyer or user concerns can increase conversion rates by as much as 80%!

Unlike a traditional website, a landing page is a web destination your site visitors will come across with a specific goal in mind. It may be the result of action taken while engaging with a call to action (CTA) or the final destination in a search for specific information. Without landing pages, your target audience may find themselves overwhelmed with information or confused about how to move down your sales funnel.

Landing pages are great resources to use if you want your clients to gain access to specific information and to drive action, however, they are often so narrow in nature that they are most effective for serving one purpose or meeting a single goal.

[Microsites]({{ 'blog/microsite-vs-website-whats-the-difference' | relative_url }}), on the other hand, offer the flexibility of incorporating multiple subpages, while maintaining the focused outlook of landing pages. They’re something like the in-between of a landing page and a website, offering visitors focused and [highly engaging content experiences]({{ 'how-top-sales-teams-create-compelling-content-experiences' | relative_url }}){:target="_blank"} that can help drive more than one action or accomplish multiple information-sharing goals.

### What are the benefits of a landing page for an agency?

Well-designed landing pages can make all the difference in creating, preserving, and expanding your agency’s web presence. They offer you the flexibility to create focused user experiences so that you can target specific goals for specific audiences.

Ultimately, these focused experiences are what allow landing pages to combat the dreaded “bounce rate,” the rate at which your site visitors leave your websites after only a quick visit. In general, online destinations [only have 15 seconds](https://www.crazyegg.com/blog/why-users-leave-a-website/){:rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"} to capture the attention of site visitors before they decide whether to stay or abandon their visit.

Although having many landing pages can help your agency increase visibility, the goal should be to drive action. Landing pages are great for this, too.

They are invaluable tools for lead generation and lead capture. The highly personalized experiences of landing pages can move clients closer to action because it makes space for targeted content. This is especially helpful if your agency serves different focuses or niches within an industry!

While a traditional website also has the option to include lead capture tools, being judicious about how often and where they are used is an important balance to strike so that you can maintain a professional web experience for your site visitors. Landing pages, on the other hand, are more flexible in this regard. We’ll discuss more on how [landing pages can help not only generate, but also capture leads]({% post_url 2023-02-06-how-to-create-a-proper-landing-page-for-lead-generation %}){:target="_blank"} in just a moment.

Generating leads, though, is only half of the battle. Once your shortlist of leads has been created, nurturing your relationships with leads becomes the next priority. If you’re skeptical about the thought of sending your lead a link to a website in an effort to maintain a relationship with them, you should be, because any old link won’t do.

The link you *should* be sharing with them leads them to a personalized online experience. Landing pages can be effective one-size-fits-all solutions for this. Having a landing page created and ready to share with your prospective clients and partners for each part of your sales can save your sales team time with communication, allowing them to focus on other pain points.

If you want to get even more personalized than that, a microsite is an even better option. Microsites allow agencies to create robust, immersive content experiences that serve multiple purposes. That way, you can share your case studies, portfolios, and other pertinent information on one easy-to-access website, rather than multiple landing pages.

The more opportunities your agency has to share specific information with your clients, the better. In many cases, sharing client testimonials and last-minute value props can serve as a hail Mary in your darkest hour!

### What makes a landing page conversion-friendly?

Ultimately, getting prospects to visit your agency’s landing pages is only useful if it converts into action, like lead capture. There are a few key elements that are included in all conversion-focused landing pages.

#### Strong headlines

Don’t underestimate the importance of strong headlines! Though they may be short and a relatively small part of your overall landing page, they are powerful for more than one reason.

Strong headlines clue your reader in on the information they will be engaging with. In most cases, it can make a difference between where or not your visitors choose to engage with the information you are putting out.

Headlines can also affect your SEO, which is why incorporating keywords and descriptive phrases in your content is so important. As with your reader, headlines are a search engine’s first introduction to the information that can be found on your page.

You can create effective headlines by [using clear, concise headlines that are specific](https://copyblogger.com/headlines-something-extra/){:rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"}. Strive to keep headlines short and sweet, generally opting for ones that are no longer than a sentence.

#### Compelling copy

Crafting engaging copy keeps visitors excited about what you have to offer and drives action. It moves site visitors further down your sales funnel and drives action.

The right copy serves as the bridge between you and your clients. It targets using consistent branding and language that emphasizes your value proposition and establishes trust in your visitors.

#### Strong calls-to-action (CTAs)

Calls to action are a critical part of a compelling landing page. They drive action and direct your landing page visitors to take action.

Strive to use concise, descriptive, and action-oriented language when crafting your CTA’s. Where you place your CTA’s is important, too!

Placing your CTA’s somewhere they can be clearly seen, like in a designated area where it is surrounded by white space, is [4x more effective than placing it elsewhere](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/8-quick-website-tweaks-boost-your-brand-april-hodge?trk=pulse-article){:rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"}.
