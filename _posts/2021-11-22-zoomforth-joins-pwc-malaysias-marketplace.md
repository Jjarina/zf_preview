**Need a microsite solution for your business? Just pop one in your basket.**
<!-- excerpt -->

If we said, ‘online marketplace’, you’d probably think, Amazon, Etsy, Ebay.

But there’s a new kind of marketplace in town. Well, in Kuala Lumpur to be precise.

PwC Malaysia has launched an innovative B2B e-commerce platform, PwC’s Marketplace ([marketplace.my.pwc.com](https://pwc.to/3kSqC6r){:rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"}), offering B2B digital solutions directly from the firm and selected third-party organisations.

Clients and prospective clients can browse and buy a range of business solutions, from data automation tools and digital communication software, to tailored financial and reporting solutions.

Chris Baradaran, Head of Digital Ventures at PwC Malaysia said of the initiative:

With our Partner Programme, we hope to support organisations big and small by making available new services and solutions in one digital ecosystem to support their transformation journey.”" %}

## Zoomforth to offer microsite solution via the platform

By joining PwC Malaysia’s Marketplace Partner Programme, Zoomforth will become one of the first third-party solutions to be offered via the new e-commerce marketplace platform.

Zoomforth will offer its no-code design software to firms of all sizes, to enable them to create personalized, branded microsites for a wide range of use-cases.

In particular, Zoomforth hopes to attract the attention of [sales and marketing]({{ 'marketing' | relative_url }}) teams that are looking to move away from traditional PDF and PowerPoint-style communication in favor of digital content experiences for their customers.

Wendie Michie, CEO of Zoomforth commented,

{% include post-cite.html img="sales-proposal-mockup-wendie.webp" alt="Wendie Michie" cite="“It’s been a real pleasure to work with PwC Malaysia over the past year, as their team prepared for the launch of this exciting new service. We’re proud to have been invited to showcase our own software on the platform; this will enable us to reach a range of potential customers in the Asia Pacific region that we might not otherwise have access to.”" %}

Mr. Baradaran added, “We’re delighted to welcome Zoomforth to our Partner Programme. The global pandemic has caused a number of businesses to look for new and engaging ways to communicate with their clients, and microsites can enable them to do just that.”

The service launched in November 2021 so, if you’re in the market for a secure website-builder that’s easy to use, go ahead and pop Zoomforth in your basket.
