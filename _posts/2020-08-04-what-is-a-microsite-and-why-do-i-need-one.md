The microsite has been getting a lot of attention recently as corporations seek to differentiate themselves from their competitors, add color to their client communications, and gain insights into how their messages are being received.

Not only is [a microsite a robust option]({{ 'blog/5-predictions-for-microsites-in-2021' | relative_url }}) for proposing your business to a new client, but it can also serve as a resource and touchpoint throughout your work with a new client.

It’s easy to confuse a landing page and its abilities with that of a microsite, but the two offer very different use cases.

Let’s take a deeper dive into the key differences between the two!

## What is a microsite

[A microsite’s main goal is to build client relationships]({{'blog/why-use-microsite-5-common-use-cases'|relative_url}}).

A microsite can be a single page but it can also be multiple pages. These sites are usually hosted on a subdomain (not natively on your own site).  Though they can be integrated with your own analytics platforms like Google, you’ll also be able to access in-app analytics to see how clients are interacting.

Perhaps most importantly, a microsite is the safest, most secure way to share commercially sensitive information, which you wouldn’t want available on a landing page. [You’d use a microsite to showcase a sales proposal]({{ 'blog/powerpoint-alternatives-for-a-modern-sales-solution' | relative_url }}), as a [client onboarding portal]({% post_url 2023-01-06-what-is-client-onboarding-and-what-do-you-need %}){:target="_blank"} or as a relationship management hub.

## Defining a landing page

A landing page’s main goal is to be used as a marketing tool.

It is usually a single page and it can be added to your own website using a native integration or a variety of third-party apps.

You’d use a landing page if you’re trying to get people to opt-in to a newsletter, get information on potential clients interested in your services or perhaps want to promote a webinar your company is hosting. You wouldn’t want to [use a landing page to host]({% post_url 2023-02-09-3-things-to-look-for-in-landing-page-hosting %}){:target="_blank"} a client proposal for example, or a cost analysis report.

Here are some specific use cases for when you’d want to use a [Landing Page or a Microsite]({% post_url 2022-08-21-microsite-vs-landing-page %})—or maybe even both.

## Microsite vs. landing page
