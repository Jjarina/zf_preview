**Reasons to convince your executives it’s time for a different approach to content**
<!-- excerpt -->

You know that it’s time your business adopted a fresh content management system (CMS). Your colleagues might too. But you still need some compelling arguments that will win over upper management.

At Zoomforth, we’ve helped countless organizations move from putting together individual static documents to designing navigable and [feature-rich microsites using our platform]({{ 'comparison-qwilr' | relative_url }}).

In this article, we present some helpful reasons you can offer to your team to make the case for [an exciting new content experience platform]({{'content-experience-platforms-why-you-need-them-and-how-to-get-started'|relative_url}}){:target="_blank"} that will empower you to make the most of your online presence.

## Increase revenue

Digital sales proposals tend to do better than static presentations in terms of winning over recipients and encouraging them to award business to your organization.

Relative to text-heavy resources such as PDFs or presentations, microsites or CMS-developed content:

* Allows you to [create more engaging content experiences]({{ 'how-top-sales-teams-create-compelling-content-experiences' | relative_url }}){:target="_blank"} for buyers by integrating multimedia elements and other assets
* Allows marketing departments to run A/B tests in order to test out variations of a page and target their readership with the most engaging version
* Gives teams the freedom to create individualized business proposals targeted directly at individuals or smalls groups within a company (account based marketing)

All the above translates into a greater ratio of won bids and higher income for your business.

## Decrease costs

Software as a Service (SaaS) involves companies making software products available over the internet in exchange for a subscription fee. In order to make their services accessible through a login on the internet, the companies behind SaaS products provision the underlying technical infrastructure necessary for this to work.

This frees up users from the hassle of having to take care of servers, other hardware, and networking. Additionally, users can rest assured that the SaaS provider is making necessary updates to the platform and maintaining its security.

For smaller organizations without an in-house IT team, using these services can be a great way to not have to worry about keeping applications and infrastructure secure.

SaaS has revolutionized computing (think of Gmail), but it’s not only webmail providers that make their services available in this way — many CMS companies, including Zoomforth, deliver their technology through this model.

Using Zoomforth, companies can design and create compelling microsites using an easy and attractive website builder. Because hosting is included as part of the subscription package, users have no infrastructural worries or associated costs. They only need to pay an ongoing fee to retain access to the software. The result of this more efficient delivery model is cost savings / easier budget management for users.

## Speed to market

These days, many large companies contract the design and upkeep of their sales and marketing assets  to internal or external design agencies. There are costs associated with this.

For one, the update process can be tediously slow. Busy agencies juggle dozens of active projects and even a small text edit can become another item on their to-do list. The result is that many frustrated pursuits managers report waiting weeks for agencies to make simple changes to their content.

*Spend less time waiting and get infront of your prospects sooner.*

Using Zoomforth’s what you see is what you get (WYSIWYG editor), just about anybody can learn how to design, duplicate, and update microsites. The simple drag and drop interface makes it easy to both create and update pages. The results are that this task can be brought back where it belongs: under your competence.

Costly agency retainers can be replaced with Zoomforth’s simple per-seat licensing price model. The results are freed up budget for your team — and having to wait minutes, rather than weeks, to make important content updates.

## Reduce risk

These days, cybersecurity is on everybody’s lips. No company wants to be known as the one that breached privacy rules or spread malware to others.

Sending information as attachments to email has known vulnerabilities — for one, if the computer sending the file is infected then the file might be, too. Sending a link to a microsite containing that information is a safer strategy.

File scanning (for viruses) can be taken care of server-side (another task you won’t need to worry about!). The files can be stored encrypted and access can be secured by second factor authentication (2FA) — making it much harder for unauthorized parties to gain access.

Sharing information through microsites reduces the risk that businesses will breach compliance regulations.

## Improved user experience

For your recipient, the microsite presentation reduces friction and is a much more enjoyable way to consume the content that you wish to transit. Compare viewing a microsite, for the recipient, to trying to piece together various emails from several different senders — the microsite experience comes out on top every time. This is particularly true if you are trying to transmit business proposals.

Additionally, a microsite makes it easy to bake in your brand guidelines to your communication. Users can customize their styling to create the exact look and feel that best reflects their company’s brand. Achieving this kind of standardization with file based communications like PDF and PowerPoint is significantly harder.

## It’s a differentiator

Finally, using microsites to transmit business proposals is an easy but effective way for you to differentiate your business from the competition. Many companies are still sending out long (yawn-inducing) PDF documents to potential buyers. The content might be compelling, but static documents confer several disadvantages — for both sides.

Sending over a microsite, especially a personalized one, targeted to the organization, is likely to resonate very well with buying audiences — particularly younger ones. Many B2B buyers are millennial or Gen-Z digital natives and they will be particularly appreciative of this new and engaging way of sending over information. This brings us back to our first point – increased sales income!
