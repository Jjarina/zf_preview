Sometimes too much of a good thing can be bad. Ice cream, wine, Justin Bieber, and content. Yes, *content*.
<!-- excerpt -->

So what’s considered bad content?

Bad content might be a short blog post without any [case studies or data]({{ 'case-studies' | relative_url }}) to back it up.

Or it’s an ‘About Us’ PDF that looks like it was created in MS-DOS.

It could also be a lengthy PowerPoint presentation for a potential client that doesn’t offer any customized touches beyond the introductory page.

You need to have high-quality content targeted to your specific audience if you want any content efforts to convert—especially when it’s for a new client acquisition. When you use a platform like Zoomforth, you’re able to build interactive content experiences for both present and future clients.

And with a platform like ours (*cough, cough*, humblebrag alert, *cough*) it’s easy, intuitive, targeted and secure with real-time analytics to make sure the content you’re investing in is appealing to your clients.

A platform like ours allows you to [create a microsite]({{ 'blog/what-is-a-microsite-and-why-do-i-need-one' | relative_url }}) that can house custom and boilerplate content for each potential client.

Here’s just a few of the benefits for creating a unique customer experience on a digital platform.

## #1. Save time and money

What could we all use more of? Time and money!

Don’t bother creating a quick video intro about your company for every digital experience you create. And an ‘About Us’ PDF with corporate headshots has been done a billion times.

Instead, invest in one really great video that tours around the office, gets a quick peek at the team and shows off your team personality that can be used again and again in your [digital platforms for clients]({{ 'blog/digital-proposals-change-the-way-you-pitch-clients' | relative_url }}).

For evergreen content or content you use regularly regardless of the client (like about us pages, team bios, leadership background, etc) you can put some money into creating some really stellar videos or photos to use for every pitch.

When you use a platform like Zoomforth, you’ll have access to templates you can use time and time again, and that can be customized without any graphic designers or web pros every time you create a new client proposal.

## #2. Make a client feel super special

Let’s get one thing straight. People like to be wooed, whether it’s a first date or a client proposal.

Show a potential client you’ve done your research on them and [create some curated thought leadership](https://neilpatel.com/blog/content-creation-how-to-create-better-content-for-your-customers/){:rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"}. Take the time to understand their specific needs and from there, expand on how your business will fulfill those needs.

One example might be to create a unique infographic that lays out a solution to a problem, rather than write up some lengthy prose that’s less engaging.

Or perhaps your potential client’s brand mascot is a squirrel. Why not toss in a few squirrel puns throughout your presentation to show them you’re paying attention. No idea is too nutty if it’s specific to a client.

## #3. Less friction, more fun

From the perspective of a potential client, digging through multiple business proposals can get boring quickly.

Imagine serving a client a custom digital content experience that they can access online [rather than by downloading a hefty PowerPoint from their email.]({{ 'blog/powerpoint-alternatives-for-a-modern-sales-solution' | relative_url }})

Rather than offer up a 50-page presentation that can be cumbersome to wade through, you can ensure the navigation is customized to accommodate different stakeholder’s interests.

And imagine that you’re the only one that has offered a proposal in a digital format.

Your client will only need to save one link from their email to access every document, video or infographic you’ve created for them rather than have to toil through attachments in an email or Google folder.

Take that pain point away from them and that’s exactly how you stand out in a sea of bids.

## #4. Assess how content is performing

Look at analytics. And assess your ROI.

With a digital content experience, you can actually have accurate data that reflects your ROI in a variety of ways.

At a high level, you can see how many people are visiting the site, what they’re clicking on, what device they’re using and which pages are the most popular. That’s not something you can get in any other medium.

And if you want to dive deeper into analytics, a digital content platform allows you to have access to who accessed certain files, how far into that fancy ‘About Us’ video they watched and how far they did read through a PDF presentation. Talk about powerful insights.

Not only do these notifications allow you to tweak information in real-time, it lets you know how to better serve your client throughout your time working together.

## #5. Don’t be a hack

And don’t let any client information *get* hacked.

In a world where even big corporations have been prone to security breaches, clients are growing more and more nervous about sharing sensitive data – especially if it’s over email.

The right digital platform allows you to create a secure site so every stakeholder can rest easy with sharing important financials or other information they’d rather not get leaked over email.

At Zoomforth our enterprise security allows your content experience to be protected by a password, email authentication, multi-factor authentication or internal sign-on.

Goodbye forever to unsecured emails with file-based attachments!

Own the customer digital experience from start to finish with a platform that allows you to create a custom content experience every step of the way. Not only will you be an authority within your field, but you can happily engage your clients with fun, warm and unique content along the way.

It’s a win-win. Now put on some Bieber and pass us the ice cream.
