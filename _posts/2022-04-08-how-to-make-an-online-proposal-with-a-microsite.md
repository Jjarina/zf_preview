It’s a [sales pitch]({{ 'sales' | relative_url }}) intended to persuade the potential client [to hire for professional services]({{ 'recruiting' | relative_url }}) such as accountants.

An online proposal using a microsite is essentially a website that’s been created for the sole purpose of pitching a product or service. It’s a way to demonstrate previous projects for customers – which, in effect, shows why you’re the best firm for the job.

Microsites typically comprise six to seven pages worth of content. It includes all the key information about your proposal, such as:

* Your deliverables

* Your team
* Your qualifications

## How to make a business proposal online with a microsite

A microsite is also a great way to present previous work from current or old customers in order to get new clients.

When you create a microsite for your business, you can include a portfolio of your previous work, testimonials from happy clients, and information about your team.

Here are some key sections to include when creating your proposal using a microsite.

### Decide what content you want to include on your online microsite proposal

When you’re creating a microsite for your business, you need to decide what content you want to include. This might be documents, video, audio, news feeds, interactive graphs, and charts. All kinds of dynamic content can be added.

### Define the problem and your proposed solution

The first step to any proposal is defining the problem.

What problem are you solving for your client? Once you’ve defined the problem, you need to state your solution. How are you going to solve the client’s problem? This sounds pretty obvious but it is amazing how often this part is missed.

### Define your deliverables and success criteria

What deliverables will you be providing to the client? And what success criteria will you establish? You need to make it very clear what the client will be getting for their money (and, perhaps, what is out of scope).

### Outline your project schedule and budget

Next, you need to outline your project schedule and budget. When will the project start and end? And how much will it cost?

### Other information

It’s a good idea to include your qualifications (social proof, like testimonials from past clients, can be very compelling) along with biographical information about your team.

### Choose an online proposal template

The next step is to choose a template for your microsite. The [microsite platform]({{ 'inspiration' | relative_url }}) you use will likely have a number of options to choose from.

### Create a custom URL

Once you’ve added your content to your [microsite template]({{ 'inspiration' | relative_url }}), you need to choose a custom URL. This is the link that people will use to access your site.

## Track your results

Once you have shared your microsite link with your prospective customer, the last step is to track your results. You can see how many people have viewed the site, what they looked at, and whether or not they’ve downloaded your proposal or any other documents you provided. This information can be helpful when you’re trying to close a deal.
