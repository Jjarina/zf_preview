We are excited to announce that Zoomforth has been awarded a High Performer rating by leading software marketplace, G2.
<!-- excerpt -->

In its Winter 2023 Report, G2 recognised Zoomforth’s performance based on a series of independent reviews, submitted by Zoomforth users.

Zoomforth scores particularly highly for its:

* User, Role, and Access Management
* Content Creation Tools
* Quality of Support

The accolade marks the end of a successful year for Zoomforth in which we welcomed a host of new enterprise clients, and delivered a series of features to make it even easier for users to create beautiful, branded microsites at scale.

Morgane Gugenheim, Director of Customer Success commented: “We’re delighted to have been recognised by G2 for the customer satisfaction ratings we’ve received this year. We’re particularly pleased for our Support Team, who work 24/7 to ensure our customers have everything they need.

We measure our impact internally, using another trusted metric: the Net Promoter Score (NPS). We are extremely proud to consistently achieve an exceptional score of +73 against an industry average of +40.

Although NPS gives us a great indication of how our customers feel about our service, it’s reassuring to know that independent reviews back this up.”

## What our customers say

Recent reviews on the G2 platform include several from large scale professional services firms such as Zoomforth’s [Big Four](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Four_accounting_firms){:rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"} clients. They describe Zoomforth as:

“Best platform to create engaging websites”, “Easy to learn and use” and “A big differentiator”.

Zoomforth’s support services are described as:

“Amazing - extremely knowledgeable, helpful, prompt, and kind.”

As well as being heart-warming to read, the Zoomforth product team also gains a lot of insight from these reviews.

Wendie Michie, CEO, explained: “When reviewing the platform on G2, customers will often call out features or improvements they would like to see included in future versions of the software. This feedback is fed directly into the product development roadmapping process to ensure the platform evolves in a way that is most helpful to our users.”
