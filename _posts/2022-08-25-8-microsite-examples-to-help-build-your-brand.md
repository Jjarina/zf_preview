A robust web presence is no longer an exceptional quality for most brands; engaging and information-rich digital content has become a standard across most industries. <!-- excerpt -->Typically, your company’s website is the most foundational starting point, but there are other avenues to extend your reach. You may consider creating a microsite! Just look at a few microsite examples and application options and you’ll be all set to make your own.

However, what is a microsite? It is a miniature website for targeted audiences that features information-rich content. These highly specialized [content experiences]({{ 'blog/make-a-content-experience-effective' | relative_url }}) are tailored to achieve more specific goals than a general webpage. A microsite can be more successful in providing valuable, focused information to its audience.

If you feel like you’re hitting a plateau when it comes to content creation, microsites might lead you to your next project. They serve a host of purposes and can be as creative or immersive as you want them to be. They truly are only limited to the scope of your needs or imagination.

Not sure where to start? Here are [some microsite examples]({{ 'inspiration' | relative_url }}) to inspire your next microsite.

## 8 microsite examples to inspire your next project

### Create a one page sales pitch

Long gone are the days of slide decks! If you’re looking for a way to elevate [sales pitches]({{ 'blog/digital-proposals-change-the-way-you-pitch-clients' | relative_url }}), look no further. By creating a microsite for your marketing one-pager, you can [make your pitch stand out]({{ 'blog/digital-proposals-change-the-way-you-pitch-clients' | relative_url }}) as both useful and engaging.

A microsite one pager sales pitch allows you to get all of the same information across to potential clients and partners in a more digestible way. You can narrow the focus to key pieces of information that you want to highlight. Importantly, by making use of an interactive interface for your one-pager, you give your audience control.

Here are some examples of what you can include in your one-pager microsite:

* Highlight your product features and services front-and-center
* Include customer testimonials to add credibility to your pitch
* Leverage the power of statistics with easily consumable charts and graphs
* Tailor your one-pager specifically to your potential client or partner

Whether your client is on their phone, computer, or tablet, they’ll have easy access to product and service information. A microsite sales proposal beats looking through text-heavy emails or printed deliverables because it’s fashioned for the modern age. Communicating your message will be much easier when you have a content experience to pair with it.

### Create a branded microsite for marketing and sales proposals

If you can create a sales [pitch with a microsite]({{'blog/digital-proposals-change-the-way-you-pitch-clients'|relative_url}}){:target="_blank"}, why not house your full business proposal on an interactive microsite of its own?

A business proposal is your first date with opportunities that lie ahead. That being said, creating and delivering one can be nerve-wracking, and it’s made even more worrying when the industry standard for a proposal is a lengthy document with a full table of contents.

With a microsite, you can [create the perfect proposal]({{ 'blog/how-to-make-an-online-proposal-with-a-microsite' | relative_url }}){:target="_blank"} that has all of the information your prospective customer will need in a medium that’s much more engaging. Along with necessary information, you can tailor content based on what you anticipate your audience will want to hear, making you better prepared. Plus, microsites are easy to update, meaning you can add more as discussions continue.

Here are some examples of what you can include in your business proposal microsite:

* Your executive summary
* Your business credentials
* Deliverables, milestones, and case studies
* Links to pertinent presentations
* Engaging layout and visuals

The benefits of a microsite include the ability to offer something more information-rich than a slideshow, more engaging than a bound hardcopy, and more accessible than a recorded virtual meeting. Impress your potential clients with an interactive experience and stand out from the crowd.

### Create a pre-launch or launch event microsite

Is your company hosting an upcoming conference? Is it sponsoring a fundraising event for a charity? It can be difficult to get the news out about an event that isn’t just an email newsletter. Plus, it may be difficult to consolidate information about the event. You should consider creating a microsite for all event-related content.

Through the microsite, you can market the event as precisely as you need to. While providing the necessary details about the event, you can also check the pulse of interaction with event content. Customizable security preferences make it easy for you to keep the event as private or public as you’d like.

Here are some examples of what to include in your event microsite:

* An overview of the event’s purpose
* Key speakers and figures attending
* A schedule of the programs
* Details on the location and venue
* A registration portal

### Create a campaign microsite to offer an interactive experience to your audience

As marketing evolves, more and more businesses are experimenting with the value of combining [inbound and outbound marketing strategies](https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnhall/2015/04/12/the-value-of-events-in-a-marketing-world/){:rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"}. Leveraging the power of these strategies in conjunction with one another creates authentic, robust relationships between brands and consumers. A microsite is a low-effort way to capitalize on the power of both marketing strategies.

If you’ve spent any time looking through creative ways to use microsites, you’ve likely heard about how companies have used them to make their new campaigns immersive and engaging. The nice thing about microsite marketing is that you can experiment with it, as it’s separate from your company website and main branding.

You can create highly immersive web experiences for users to become exposed to product and service information while interacting with brand content. This might include using games, customization tools, or leveraging consumer data.

Here are some examples of immersive [experiences created through microsites]({{'blog/how-to-create-a-microsite'|relative_url}}){:target="_blank"}:

* [Spotify’s “Listening Together” microsite](https://newsroom.spotify.com/2020-05-07/audio-connects-us-all-in-spotifys-newest-campaign-listening-together/){:rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"} allows users to interact with, and witness, the power of its social listening features firsthand.

### Create a career portal for open positions in your company

Leveraging microsites isn’t just for marketing purposes—a microsite can also drive recruitment efforts! If you’re looking to get the attention of a young, tech-based workforce, having a microsite career portal is an easy way to embrace digital employment strategies. With a microsite, you can create customized postings and applications.

Having your own career portal is a great way to identify candidates who are specifically interested in your company. A microsite gives them all the information they need about your company and detailed descriptions of available jobs. Microsites are also very easy to update. If you fill a position, you can simply modify your microsite to remove that position.

Here are some examples of what you can include in your career portal microsite:

* Available positions in your company
* Compensation and benefit information
* Available growth opportunities
* Mission statement and workplace values
* Past partnerships and awards

### Create a friendly welcome page for a new hire

When you have a new hire, an online welcome page is a fantastic way to make them feel welcomed and appreciated; plus, it might cut out the time (and awkwardness) of icebreaker introductions. A microsite is perfectly suited for this!

A welcome page for your new hire allows them to dip their toes into your workplace at their own pace. You can roll welcome messages into information-rich pages by including information about onboarding dates, team contact information, and log-in credentials.

Here are some examples of what you can include in your welcome page microsite:

* A personalized greeting and welcome message
* Important company and position information
* Introductions from different members of the team
* Helpful resources for them to get started

Making new hires [feel welcomed and valued reduces turnover rates](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/5-ways-help-your-new-employees-feel-more-welcome-rafael-maga%C3%B1a){:rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"}, which can go a long way in establishing a consistent workplace culture and staying productive. Taking the time to craft a welcome page microsite shows that you value them as a new addition to your team.

### Create a personalized onboarding portal for your employees

After creating a welcome page for your new hire, why not create a [microsite as a personalized onboarding portal]({% post_url 2023-01-06-what-is-client-onboarding-and-what-do-you-need %}){:target="_blank"} for them?

Catching your new employees up on all of the important information they need to know about your organization can be an overwhelming task for everyone involved. Information overload and an inability to revisit shared information can make onboarding feel pointless.

Creating a microsite that houses important onboarding information helps sidestep some of the [most common challenges](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/247172/problems-onboarding-program.aspx){:rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"} organizations face during onboarding. A microsite creates the opportunity for learning employees and new hires to always have access to information they need without having to run through several chains of communication.

Here are some examples of what you can include in an onboarding portal microsite:

* Workplace values and policies
* Tutorials on standards operation procedures
* Videos on your company’s impacts
* Chain of command and employee directory
* Interactive quizzes and games to gauge learning

Content can be focused on processes, policies, and other pertinent onboarding information. Your microsite can serve as your knowledge management system that is easily accessed and updated.

### Create an interactive learning portal for employee training

Looking to update standard operating procedures, policies, or marketing strategies? Skip the long-winded email—or worse yet, the meeting that could have been an email—and try interactive microsites instead.

A microsite with engaging material like videos, quizzes, and discussion boards allows your employees to review new information as often as they need, working through it on their own time.

It’s a robust solution that allows you to tackle getting your remote and in-office employees up-to-speed without sacrificing efficiency, time, and manpower. These websites are easy to update, too. That means that you don’t have to roll out entirely new training every time minor details change—you can simply update the webpage’s information.

A microsite allows you to share all of this information through an encrypted site, making it just as secure as a traditional learning management system.
