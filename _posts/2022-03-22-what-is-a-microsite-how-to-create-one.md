Microsites are often used to promote specific products or services or target a particular audience. They can also be used to test new ideas or strategies before rolling them out on your primary website.
<!-- excerpt -->

A [microsite]({{ 'blog/what-is-a-microsite-and-why-do-i-need-one' | relative_url }}) is a separate web page or group of pages designed to achieve a specific use case. At Zoomforth, companies use microsites to [showcase digital sales proposals]({{ 'blog/powerpoint-alternatives-for-a-modern-sales-solution' | relative_url }}), [learning portals]({{ 'learning' | relative_url }}), [event sites]({% post_url 2023-02-06-creating-a-landing-page-for-your-event-here-is-what-you-need %}){:target="_blank"}, and client experience sites.

Creating a microsite is easy – all you need is a domain name and web hosting.

The critical thing to remember when creating a microsite is that it should serve a specific purpose. Your microsite should also be easy to navigate, and it should be well-written and rich in relevant content.

This article will explore what a microsite is, compared to a traditional website, and detail the process behind creating and hosting a microsite.

## What are microsites?

The goal of a microsite is to provide a platform for specific personas to discover your business. These personas can range from prospects, current clients, and job candidates to employees.

So, what is the definition of microsites? A microsite is a branded content site outside of your company’s website.

Microsites will usually sit on a subdomain or your main domain and have their own unique URLs. This makes the microsite even more special for the target audience that’s using it.

The goal is to provide a laser-focused experience. [A microsite is a great solution]({{ 'blog/5-predictions-for-microsites-in-2021' | relative_url }}) when you need to:

* Promote a new product or service
* On-board new employees to your organization
* Showcase a business proposal in response to an RFP
* Give info to job applicants about working at your firm

Having a microsite is helpful since it allows visitors to obtain information about an occasion or campaign in one location rather than having them dig all over your website.

Multiple situations would warrant the use of a microsite, including but not limited to:

* A brand that wants to build a website for a specific product or service
* [Recruiting teams]({{ 'recruiting' | relative_url }}) looking to manage targeted career sites
* A company that wants to [generate leads for its sales]({{ 'sales' | relative_url }}) team
* An organization that wants to capture employee data through surveys or signups
* A business that wants to [conduct A/B testing](https://netflixtechblog.com/its-all-a-bout-testing-the-netflix-experimentation-platform-4e1ca458c15){:rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"}

## Microsite vs. website

Microsites are used to eliminate distractions and focus on a specific item. However, microsites may include links to publications, blog entries, company news, updates, and so forth. The beauty of microsites is that they are more focused on a certain goal yet can include rich media to make the experience luxurious.

Some of the main [differences between microsites and websites]({% post_url 2022-09-18-microsite-vs-website-whats-the-difference %}){:target="_blank"} include:

* **Microsites are not the primary site for a business**. They are usually less than ten pages long, but they can be as many pages as you want.
* **Microsites frequently have their own domain** (e.g., mymicrosite.com), but they may also be hosted on a sub-domain (e.g., microsite.mycompany.com).
* **Microsites are generally used for short-term campaigns or purposes**. They are not meant to be permanent like websites, but can have a permanent shelf-life if you want.

The main difference between a microsite and a website is that a microsite is usually created to support a specific campaign or product. In contrast, a website’s purpose is more general. For example, if your company offers multiple services, each with its own microsite, your main website would likely be used to provide general information about the company, while the microsites focus on individual services.

## Examples of microsites for campaigns, products & brands

Microsite creation is a popular solution for businesses with multiple products and services. Nike, Coca-Cola, Ford, and Apple are just a few well-known [brands that have created microsites]({% post_url 2022-08-25-8-microsite-examples-to-help-build-your-brand %}){:target="_blank"} to support specific product lines or marketing campaigns.
