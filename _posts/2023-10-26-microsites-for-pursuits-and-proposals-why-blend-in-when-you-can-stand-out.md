## Pursuits Microsites

In today's rapidly evolving business landscape, traditional proposal methods are losing their luster. **Bid farewell to static PDFs and outdated PowerPoint presentations** (except for when they demand it in that format… but we’ll get to that soon!) – it's time to usher in a new era of captivating proposal experiences created as microsites.

## Breaking Free from Static Proposals

Sending out proposals in PDF or PowerPoint format feels like using a rotary phone in a smartphone world. Static content lacks engagement and leaves recipients with more questions than answers. The PDF was created to be a digital paper and serves its purpose well, and don’t get me wrong, there are ways to really make a PDF more engaging, but it requires a very specific skill set and a lot of time.

## Game-Changing proposals

**Microsites empower you** to create personalized, interactive, and visually stunning proposal experiences. Imagine tailoring your pitch to each client's unique needs, aspirations, and pain points. These microsites are [more than proposals]({% post_url 2020-07-21-digital-proposals-change-the-way-you-pitch-clients %}); they're **immersive experiences** that make a lasting impact.

## Making Relevance Count

Say goodbye to generic, one-size-fits-all proposals. **Microsites put personalization at the forefront**. Craft narratives that resonate on a personal level, addressing specific needs and showcasing tailored solutions. Highlight your executive summary, value proposition, case studies, and relevant success stories to add authenticity. With the use of imagery, video, gifts, text, embeds and more the content isn’t only seen, it is felt.

## Tracking Engagement

Sending a proposal without knowing how it's received is like casting a message in a bottle. Microsites offer **tracking capabilities** that shed light on recipient engagement. Understand which sections capture attention, and even when it's shared internally. This data isn't just numbers; **it's a goldmine of client insights**.

## Empowering Wins with Insights

The path from pitch to close isn't linear—it's a dance. **Microsites gather intelligence** that guides your approach. Identify resonating sections and refine others. Tailor follow-up conversations with clarity, addressing concerns directly and reinforcing your value proposition.

## Nurturing Impactful Journeys

Proposals mark the start of a larger narrative. Dynamic microsites help you craft that narrative seamlessly.

Grant access only to authorized parties and rest easy knowing [your proposals are protected]({{'platform-security-features'|relative_url}}).
