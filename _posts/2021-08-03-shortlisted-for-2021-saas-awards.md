*International Software Awards Program Announces Finalists*
<!-- excerpt -->

**San Francisco – 27 July 2021 –** Zoomforth is a finalist in the 2021 [SaaS Awards](https://www.cloud-awards.com/software-as-a-service-awards/){:rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"} Program in the category ‘Best Enterprise Level SaaS Product’.

Now in its sixth year of celebrating software innovation, the [Software-as-a-Service Awards](https://www.cloud-awards.com/software-as-a-service-awards/){:rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"} program accepts entries worldwide, including the US, Canada, Australasia, EMEA and UK.

Categories for 2021 include Best Enterprise-Level SaaS and Best Data-Driven SaaS, alongside new categories including ‘Bespoke SaaS Solution’.

Head of operations for the SaaS Awards, James Williams, said: “Just as SaaS technologies have been vital in pivoting organizational functions to respond to global crises, they will be essential as we look forward to returning to normal levels of productivity.

“We’ve seen remarkably innovative solutions across all conceivable areas of industry, and it’s increasingly difficult for our team to identify the entrants that can’t make it past this shortlist stage.

“The shortlisted candidates announced today, however, have made it through that first round. They represent truly innovative thinkers in the SaaS industry, whether they’re freshly-funded disruptors or established names.

“Our judges have some incredibly difficult decisions to make before announcing the final winners in each category of the software awards at the end of August.”

Wendie Michie, CEO of Zoomforth said: “It is an honour to make the SaaS Awards shortlist, which recognizes our team’s creativity and innovation in developing enterprise-level SaaS technology.”

Final SaaS Awards winners will be announced on Tuesday 31 August 2021 and the program will return in Spring 2022. Hundreds of organizations entered, with international entries coming from North America, Canada, Australia, UK, Europe and the Middle East.

Last year, entry fees donated from shortlisted entrants to the ‘Communication, Collaboration and Conferencing’ category raised $3,555 for the WHO’s COVID-19 Response Fund.

A sister program to the SaaS Awards, The Cloud Awards ([https://www.cloud-awards.com/](https://www.cloud-awards.com/){:rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"}), will soon accept submissions for a new 2021-22 program, continuing its recognition of excellence in cloud computing, with an October deadline.
