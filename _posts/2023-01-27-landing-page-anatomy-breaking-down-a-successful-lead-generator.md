Landing pages are the ultimate lead-generation tool for online marketing campaigns. Knowing how to build one that drives conversions can help you and your team increase your traffic while moving leads closer to action.
<!-- excerpt -->

What makes a landing page, though? Here, we’ll break down the elements of landing page anatomy that must be included to see success from your campaigns. Let’s get started!

## What is effective landing page anatomy?

Unlike a website or microsite, a landing page does not contain navigation menus or links to other pages: it has a single goal. Landing pages are typically used as leads generator tools that target one specific action, such as signing up for a newsletter, downloading a file, or completing a purchase. They are also typically used to share a small subset of content and information focused on a specific target audience.

Landing pages are different from microsites and websites in design, too. Websites may house many subpages and have information-rich content that encourages exploration. [A microsite is a tailored content experience]({{ 'blog/microsite-vs-website-whats-the-difference' | relative_url }}) that leverages similar features of a website, but with a more focused set of subpages and CTAs. A landing page, however, is designed so that the only interaction a user needs to worry about is on the very first page they land on.

Because of this, there are some important qualities that all effective landing pages should have which may be unique from a microsite or website. Here’s what you need to know!

### Attention-grabbing headings

User experience (UX) designers and experts always take into account the most important truth about web users: they don’t read. They can read, but the overwhelming majority opt for scanning rather than reading when they can.

This is where headlines come into play! Web users [generally only scroll through 60% of any given article](https://uxmyths.com/post/647473628/myth-people-read-on-the-web){:rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"}, typically looking for key points they can pick up as they scan. Including clear, concise headings that are relevant points your visitor exactly where they want to go, which can increase engagement and reduce bounce rates. Not only this, but strong headings and meta descriptions that are relevant to your landing page content are good for your SEO, too!

### A few enticing offers

One of the easiest ways to help [grow your landing page conversion rates]({% post_url 2023-01-27-landing-page-monitoring-best-practices-to-boost-your-conversions %}){:target="_blank"} is by including offers on your landing page.

They can include anything like a free consultation, ebook, webinar, or an exclusive discount. These offers are generally provided with the caveat that visitors share contact information, sign up for a newsletter, or purchase a product or service. This can help you convert visitors into leads and at times can convert leads into sales!

Providing a special offer on your landing page has the added bonus of leaving your site visitors with a positive impression of your brand.

### Eye-pleasing graphics

A picture is worth a thousand words, but it can be worth so much more when it comes to converting visitors into leads! [For 70% of your site visitors](https://www.retaildive.com/news/72-of-consumers-prefer-videos-to-text-marketing/524161/){:rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"}, video and image-based marketing are far more effective than traditional text-based campaigns.

Incorporating images, videos, and animations are an easy way to keep users engaged without sacrificing information sharing. Incorporating product or service highlights in the form of videos, using graphs and charts to report metrics, or images that list product specs are all easy ways to create effective messaging that doesn’t encourage your site visitors to leave.

### Clear, actionable CTA

CTAs, or calls-to-action, are important elements of a landing page, as they guide visitors to take the targeted action you are looking for: for example, lead capture, driving sales, or signing up for mailing lists.

When it comes to CTAs, though, quality over quantity is important. Too many CTAs can come across as spammy and pushy, so you should always opt for using a handful of well-crafted CTAs. They should be relevant to the experience that your user is having. If you think that the campaign you are developing can target a range of actions, you might opt for a content delivery method that is more robust than a single landing page, [like a microsite]({{ 'blog/the-6-strategic-business-benefits-of-a-microsite' | relative_url }}).

## How to build a great landing page for lead generation?

### Put a lot of effort into crafting the perfect CTA

There [are some best practices when it comes to crafting a CTA](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20-calls-action-drive-engagement-james-g-beckwith){:rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"} that is conversion-focused. They should be concise and action-oriented. Use verbs that are strong and direct!

Crafting the right CTA is also about marketing the action you want visitors to take in a way that is favorable to them, not to you. For example, your CTA button may highlight the offer users receive after they complete the action, rather than the action itself, like using “Get 30% off my next order!” rather than “Sign up for the rewards program.”

Make sure your CTAs are visible and strategically placed. Bright colors and button features can help them get visitors’ attention, too!

### Focus on the right lead generation landing page design elements

Creating the perfect design for [a landing page that is focused on lead generation]({% post_url 2023-02-06-how-to-create-a-proper-landing-page-for-lead-generation %}) is essential for driving conversions.

While traditional websites may have room for play in design, the best practice for landing pages is “less is more.” Opt for a simple, clean look that has plenty of space for headings and CTAs.

Focus on making your landing page layout as easy to navigate as possible with large, bold headings that get visitors’ attention from the get-go. The layout should be easy to scroll through, and information should be easy to find with subheadings and highly visible CTAs.

### Ensure your forms work correctly

You will have a really hard time converting if your forms don’t work.

Testing forms on a [lead generation landing page]({% post_url 2023-02-06-how-to-create-a-proper-landing-page-for-lead-generation %}){:target="_blank"} is crucial for ensuring that you are capturing the information you want. Not only this, but it makes your landing page appear significantly more legitimate and creates a frictionless user experience.

Checking for usability doesn’t just mean looking for functioning links and forms; they should be easy to use, too. Make sure to check that all required fields are marked clearly and that all forms are working properly. Don’t forget to check your usability across a range of devices and web browsers.

The benefit of using a landing page that is independent of your main webpage is the ability to measure micro-level analytics. Be sure that you are hosting your web content on a tool that allows you to [leverage a full range of insight and analytic tools]({{ 'blog/microsites' | relative_url }}).

### Add testimonials that attract new customers

Including testimonials on a landing page is a great way to build trust and encourage conversions. Testimonials provide social proof and show potential customers that others have had positive experiences with your product or service.

Make sure to include real customer reviews that are honest and personal while highlighting the benefits of your product or service.
